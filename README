FINAL-EXAM PROJECT

This project simulates a simple delivery service using OOP.


1. Class Person
Attributes: name
Method: introduce() → prints out Hi, I'm <name>.

2. Class Customer (inherits from Person)
Additional attribute: address
Method: place_order(item) → returns a new DeliveryOrder object for the given item

3. Class Driver (inherits from Person)
Additional attribute: vehicle
Method: deliver(order) → prints: <driver_name> is delivering <item> to <customer_name> using <vehicle>.
Should update the order’s status to "delivered"

4. Class DeliveryOrder
Attributes:
- customer
- item
- status (initially "preparing")
Methods:
- assign_driver(driver)
- summary() → returns a string describing the order


Run in delivery_service.py 
The final output should be the same as the png in the directory.


it is 100% correctly implemented.
